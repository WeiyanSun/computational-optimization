This is a network optimization problem.
Consider a network with several nodes and edges.

Customers are located at nodes.

There are two costs: 
1. opening cost, the cost needed to open a facility at node i.
2. Traveling cost, the cost a customer at node j need to go to a facility at node i. This cost is Proportional to the distance.

If now we want to built n facilities, which nodes shall we put facility on to minimize the sum of two costs.
