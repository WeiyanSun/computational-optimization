This is a course taught by Prof. Ned Dimitrov on solving complex computational optimization problems in a real-world environment.
I have taken this course in Fall 2016. 

Entirely Python.

I collect my works for HWs and my final projects. 
Each HW folder will contains: 1. code 2. HW_guide 3. raw_data 4.results

Here is a summary of HWs and final projects.

HW5: Implement a poor-manâ€™s version of Google Maps. 
     Solving a network optimization problems using either shortest path algorithm from networkx package or constructing a linear programming by pyomo and solving by cplex.
     
     result: Give me longitude and latitude of a start place (e.g Rudy BBQ) and a destination (e.g Texas State Capitol) in Austin, this program can show you the shortest path on the map.
